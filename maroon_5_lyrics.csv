Title,Lyrics
Harder To Breathe,"How dare you say that my behavior is unacceptable
So condescending unnecessarily critical
I have the tendency of getting very physical
So watch your step cause if I do you'll need a miracle
You drain me dry and make me wonder why I'm even here
This double vision I was seeing is finally clear
You want to stay but you know very well I want you gone
Not fit to funkin' tread the ground I'm walking on
When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
There's no way we're gonna give up
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
What you are doing is screwing things up inside my head
You should know better you never listened to a word I said
Clutching your pillow and writhing in a naked sweat
Hoping somebody someday will do you like I did
When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
There's no way we're gonna give up
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Does it kill
Does it burn
Is it painful to learn
That it's me that has all the control
Does it thrill
Does it sting
When you feel what I bring
And you wish that you had me to hold
When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
There's no way we're gonna give up
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe"
Highway To Hell,"Living easy, lovin' free
Season ticket on a one-way ride
Asking nothing, leave me be
Taking everything in my stride
Don't need reason, don't need rhyme
Ain't nothing I would rather do
Going down, party time
My friends are gonna be there too
I'm on the highway to hell
highway to hell, highway to hell, highway to hell
No stop signs, speed limit
Nobody's gonna slow me down
Like a wheel, gonna spin it
Nobody's gonna mess me round
Hey Satan, payed my dues
Playing in a rocking band
Hey Momma, look at me
I'm on my way to the promised land
I'm on the highway to hell
highway to hell, highway to hell, highway to hell
(Don't stop me)
I'm on the highway to hell
highway to hell, highway to hell, highway to hell, highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
highway to hell, highway to hell, highway to hell"
If I Fell In Love With You,"If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand
'Cause I've been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands
If I give my heart to you
I must be sure from the very start
That you would love me more than her
If I trust in you
Oh no please, don't run and hide
If I love you too
Oh please, don't hurt my pride like her
'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I would be sad
If our new love was in vain
So I hope you see love that
I would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two
'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I would be sad
If our new love was in vain
So I hope you'll see that
I would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two
If I fell in love with you, yeah
No no no no no"
She Will Be Loved,"Beauty queen of only eighteen
She had some trouble with herself
He was always there to help her
She always belonged to someone else
I drove for miles and miles
And wound up at your door
I've had you so many times
But somehow I want more
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
Tap on my window knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get so insecure
It doesn't matter anymore
It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along, yeah
My heart is full and my door's always open
You come anytime you want
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
I know where you hide alone in your car
Know all of the things that make you who you are
I know that goodbye means nothing at all
Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls, yeah
Tap on my window knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
(Please don't try so hard to say goodbye)
And she will be loved
Please don't try so hard to say goodbye
Please don't try so hard to say goodbye
(I don't mind spending every day)
(Out on your corner in the pouring rain)
Please don't try so hard to say goodbye"
Sunday Morning,"Yeah oh oh oh yeah
Sunday morning rain is falling
Steal some covers, share some skin
And clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the mold that I am in
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
And I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew
That someday it would lead me back to you
That someday it would lead me back to you, oh
That may be all I need
In darkness she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
I'm driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave
My fingers trace your every outline, yeah
Paint a picture with my hands, no, no
And back and forth we sway like branches in a storm
Change of weather, still together when it ends, oh
That may be all I need
In darkness she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
I'm driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave, yeah
Oh oh yeah
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
And Sunday morning rain is falling and I'm calling out to you
Singing someday it will bring me back to you, yeah
Find a way to get myself back home to you
And you may not know
That may be all, all I, all I need
Oh, in darkness she is all, all I, I see
And now come and rest your bones with me, yeah
Driving slow, driving slow
Now yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah
There's a flower in your hair
And I'm a flower in your hair, oh oh
Oh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Sunday morning rain
On Sunday morning, yeah yeah
On Sunday morning, oh oh oh oh
I'll be home, I'll be"
The Sun,"After school, walking home
Fresh dirt under my fingernails
And I can smell hot asphalt
Cars screech to a halt to let me pass
And I cannot remember
What life was like through photographs
And trying to recreate images
Life gives us from our past
And sometimes it's a sad song
But I cannot forget, refuse to regret
So glad I met you and
Take my breath away, make everyday
Worth all of the pain that I have gone through
And mama I've been cryin'
'Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said, ""The battles almost won
And we're only several miles from the sun"" whoa yeah
And I'm moving on down the street
I see people I won't ever meet
I think of her, take a breath
Feel the beat in the rhythm of my steps
And sometimes it's a sad song, ho
But I cannot forget, refuse to regret
So glad I met you and
Take my breath away, make everyday
Worth all of the pain that I have gone through
And mama I've been cryin'
'Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said, ""The battles almost won
And we're only several miles from the sun""
The rhythm of her conversation
The perfection of her creation
The sex she slipped into my coffee
The way she felt when she first saw me
Hate to love and love to hate her
Like a broken record player
Back and forth and here and gone
And on and on and on and on
But I cannot forget, refuse to regret
So glad I met you and
Take my breath away, make everyday
Worth all of the pain that I have gone through
And mama I've been cryin'
'Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said, ""The battles almost won
And we're only several miles""
She said, ""The battles almost won
And we're only several miles from the sun"" yeah"
This Love,"I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart, oh!
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice
?Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied, oh!
Kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice
?Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
I'll fix these broken things
Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's alright
(It's alright, it's alright)
My pressure on your hips
Sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you
Because I know that's what you want me to do
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
Her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice
?Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And my heart is breaking in front of me
And she said goodbye too many times before
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
Her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice
?Cause I won't say goodbye anymore"
Better That We Break,"I never knew perfection till
I heard you speak and now it kills me
Just to hear you say the simple things
Now waking up is hard to do
Sleeping's impossible too
And every thing's reminding me of you
What can I do?
It's not right, not okay
Say the words that you're saying
Maybe we're better off this way
I'm not fine, I'm in pain
It's harder everyday
Maybe we're better off this way
It's better that we break
A fool to let you slip away
I'll chase you just to hear you say
You're scared enough
You think that I'm insane
I see you, you look so nice from here
Pity, I can't see it clearly
Why you're standing there
It disappears, it disappears
It's not right, not okay
Say the words that you're saying
Maybe we're better off this way
I'm not fine, I'm in pain
It's harder everyday
Maybe we're better off this way
It's better that we break
Saw you sitting on the lawn
You're fragile and you're cold
But that's all right
The lie these days is getting rough
Knocked you down and beat you up
But it's just a roller coaster anyway, yeah
It's not right, not okay
Say the words that you're saying
Maybe we're better off this way
I'm not fine, I'm in pain
It's harder everyday
Maybe we're better off this way
I'm not fine, I'm not okay
Say the words that you're saying
Maybe we're better off this way
I'm not fine, I'm not okay
It's harder everyday
Maybe we're better off this way
It's better that we break, baby"
Goodnight Goodnight,"You left me hanging from a thread
We once swung from together
I lick my wounds
But I can't ever see them getting better
Some thing's gotta change
Things cannot stay the same
Her hair was pressed against her face
Her eyes were red with anger
Enraged by things unsaid
And empty beds and bad behavior
Some thing's gotta change
It must be rearranged, oh
I'm sorry
I did not mean to hurt my little girl
It's beyond me
I cannot carry the weight of the heavy world
So goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, hope that things work out all right, yeah
The room was silent
As we all tried so hard to remember
The way it feels to be alive
The day that he first met her
Some thing?s gotta change
Things cannot stay the same
You make me think of someone wonderful
But I can't place her
I wake up every morning
Wishing one more time to face her
Some thing's gotta change
It must be rearranged, oh
I'm sorry
I did not mean to hurt my little girl
It's beyond me
I cannot carry the weight of a heavy world
So goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, hope that things work out all right
So much to love, so much to learn
But I won't be there to teach you, oh
I know I can be close
But I try my best to reach you
I'm so sorry
I did not mean to hurt my little girl
It's beyond me
I cannot carry the weight of a heavy world
So goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, hope that things work out all right, yeah"
If I Never See Your Face Again,"Now as the summer fades, I let you slip away
You say I'm not your type but I can make you sway
It makes you burn to learn you're not the only one
I'd let you be if you put down your blazing gun
Now you've gone somewhere else far away
I don't know if I will find you
But you feel my breath on your neck
Can't believe I'm right behind you
'Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we've gone much further than I thought we'd get tonight
Sometimes you move so well, it's hard not to give in
I'm lost, I can't tell where you end and I begin
It makes me burn to learn you're with another man
I wonder if he's half the lover that I am
Now you've gone somewhere else far away
I don't know if I will find you
But you feel my breath on your neck
Can't believe I'm right behind you
'Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we've gone much further than I thought we'd get tonight
Baby, baby, please believe me
Find it in your heart to reach me
Promise not to leave me behind
Take me down but take it easy
Make me think but don't deceive me
Torture me by taking your time
'Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we've gone much further than I thought we'd get tonight
You keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we've gone much further than I thought we'd get tonight"
Little Of Your Time,"I'm sick of picking the pieces
And second guessing my reasons
Why you don't trust me
Why must we do this to one another
We are just passionate lovers
With trouble under the covers
Nothing worse than when
You know that it's over
I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To say the words I never said
Just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To show you that I am not dead
Please don't leave, stay in bed
Touch my body instead
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?
Well, I've got nothing to hide
Dip down and come for a ride
I'm racing the devil so sly
You cannot hear 'em coming
'Cause my defenses are weak
I have no breath left to speak
So take the evidence
And bury it somewhere
I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To say the words I never said
Just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To show you that I am not dead
Please don't leave, stay in bed
Touch my body instead
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?
Oh my, I don't mind being the other guy
Nice try, for these games, I do not have the time
If you want me, call me, come and take a risk
Kiss me somewhere deep below the surface
I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To say the words I never said
I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To show you that I am not dead
Please don't leave, stay in bed
Touch my body instead
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?"
Makes Me Wonder,"Wake up with blood-shot eyes
Struggled to memorize
Way it felt to hearing lies
People that made you cry
Feel so good to be bad
Not worth the aftermath
After that, after that
Try to get you back
I still don't have the reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a thought about you
Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to try
Yeah, so this is goodbye
Can?t stop my spinning head
Decisions that made my bed
Now I must lay in it
Deal with things I've left unsaid
Want to dive into you
Forget what you're going through
Get behind, make your move
Forget about the truth
I still don't have a reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a thought about you
Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference
Even makes a difference to try, yeah
And you told me how you're feelin'
But I don't believe it's true anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
So this is goodbye
I've been here before, one day, a week
And it won't hurt anymore
You caught me in a lie, I have no alibi
The words you said don't have a meaning 'cause
I still don't have a reason and you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a thought about you and I
So this is goodbye
Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference
Even makes a difference to try, yeah
And you told me how you're feelin'
But I don't believe it's true anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
So this is goodbye
So this is goodbye
Yeah, so this is goodbye
Yeah, so this is goodbye"
Not Falling Apart,"Danced all night and slept all day
Careless with my heart again
Fearless when it comes to playing games
You don't cry and you don't care
Afraid to have a love affair
Is that your ghost or are you really there?
Now I can't walk, I can't talk anymore
Since you walked out the door
And now I'm stuck, living out that night again
I'm not falling apart
Wither on a sunny day
Time slows down, I wish you'd stay
Pass me by in crowded dark hallways
Try my hardest not to scream
I find my heart is growing weak
So leave your reasons on the bathroom sink
Now I can't walk, I can't talk anymore
Since you walked out the door
And now I'm stuck, living out that night again
I'm not falling apart
I heard you say you needed me
Now what's the problem? I can't see
You destroyed me, I won't fall apart again
I'm not falling apart
Take what you want
And I will be just fine
You will be better off alone at night
Waiting and falling
Constantly calling out your name
Will it ever change?
Now I can't walk, I can't talk anymore
Since you walked out the door
And now I'm stuck living out that night again
I'm not falling apart
I heard you say you needed me
Now what's the problem? I can't see
You destroyed me, I won't fall apart again
I'm not falling apart"
Secret [Premier 5 Remix],"Watch the sunrise
Say your goodbyes
Off we go
Some conversation
No contemplation
Hit the road
Car overheats
Jump out of my seat
On the side of the highway baby
Our road is long
Your hold is strong
Please don't ever let go, oh no
I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
Oh can they keep it
Oh no they can't
Driving fast now
Don't think I know how to go slow
Where you at now
I feel around
There you are
Cool these engines
Calm these jets
I ask you how hot can it get
And as you wipe of beads of sweat
Slowly you say, ""I'm not there yet""
I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
Oh can they keep it
Oh no they can't
I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
Oh but can they keep it
Oh no they can't"
Shiver,"You build me up, you knock me down
Provoke a smile and make me frown
You are the queen of run around
You know it's true
You chew me up and spit me out
Enjoy the taste, I leave in your mouth
You look at me, I look at you
Neither of us know what to do
And there may not
Be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in
I shiver when I hear your name
I think about you but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied 'til I'm under your skin
Immobilized by the thought of you
Paralyzed by the sight of you
Hypnotized by the words you say
Not true but I believe 'em anyway
So come to bed it's getting late
There's no more time for us to waste
Remember how my body tastes
You feel your heart begin to race
There may not
Be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in
I shiver when I hear your name
I think about you but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied 'til I'm under your skin
You feel your heart begin to race
There may not
Be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in
And I shiver when I hear your name
I think about you but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied 'til I'm under your skin, yeah
There may not
Be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in
And I shiver when I hear your name
I think about you but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied 'til I'm under your skin, yeah"
Wake Up Call,"I didn't hear what you were saying
I live on raw emotion, baby
I answer questions, never maybe
And I'm not kind if you betray me
So who the hell are you to say 'we'?
I never would've made it, baby
If you needed love, well, then ask for love
Could've given love, now I'm taking love
And it's not my fault 'cause you both deserve
What's coming now, so don't say a word
Wake up call, caught you in the morning
With another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Don't you care about me? I don't think so!
Six foot tall, came without a warning
So I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here, I don't think so!
I would've bled to make you happy
You didn't need to treat me that way
And now you've beat me at my own game
And now I found you sleeping soundly
And your love is screaming loudly
I hear a sound and hit the ground
If you needed love, well, then ask for love
Could've given love, now I'm taking love
And it's not my fault 'cause you both deserve
What's coming now, so don't say a word
Wake up call, caught you in the morning
With another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Don't you care about me? I don't think so!
Six foot tall, came without a warning
So I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here, I don't feel so bad
I don't feel so bad, I don't feel so bad
I'm so sorry, darling
Did I do the wrong thing?
Oh, what was I thinking?
Is his heart still beating?
Wake up call, caught you in the morning
With another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Don't you care about me? I don't think so!
Six foot tall, came without a warning
So I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here, I don't feel so bad
Wake up call, caught you in the morning
With another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Care about me? I don't think so!
Six foot tall, came without a warning
So I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
No, he won't come around here, I don't feel so bad
Wake up call, caught you in the morning
With another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Don't you care about me? I don't feel so bad
Wake up call, caught you in the morning
With another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?"
Woman,"If I'd be so inclined to climb up beside you
Would you tell me that the time just isn't right?
And if I should ever find the key you hide so well
Will you tell me that I can spend the night?
Leaving your smell on my coat
Leaving your taste on my shoulder
I still fail to understand what it is about this woman
If l could bottle up the chills that you gave me
I would keep them in a jar next to my bed
And if I should ever draw a picture of a woman
It is you that would come flowing from my pen, yeah
Leaving your clothes on my floor
Making me walk out the door and
I still fail to understand what it is about this woman
Fail to understand what it is about this woman
Helplessly melting as I stand next to the sun
As she burns me, I am screaming loud for more
I drink every drop of liquid heat that I've become
Pop me open spill me out onto the floor
Leaving your smell on my coat
Leaving your taste on my shoulder
I still fail to understand, fail to understand
Leaving your smell on my coat
Leaving your taste on my shoulder
I still fail to understand what it is about this woman
Yes"
Back At Your Door,"From the moment the lights went off
Everything had changed
Lie awake in an empty room
In my head, it all feels the same
Like the taste of the day you left
It still lingers on my breath
And the dampness of tears that left
That stain where you had wept
All alone with the negligee
That still hangs off of my bed
I keep meaning to give it away
But I just leave it there instead
No need to cry about it
I cannot live without it
Every time I wind up back at your door
Why do you do this to me?
You penetrate right through me
Every time I wind up back at your door
Three more days 'til I see your face
I'm afraid, it's far too much
Cook a meal and fix up the place
Dial your number, hang it up
If I took you for granted
I apologize for acting tough
You're my reason for living
And there's no way I'm giving up
No need to cry about it
I cannot live without it
Every time I wind up back at your door
Why do you do this to me?
You penetrate right through me
Every time I wind up back at your door
Now every evening is a bitter fight
And I'm eating all alone on a Friday night
And I know what your friends say
?He?s just wasting your love and time?
I will never let you change your mind
No need to cry about it
I cannot live without it
Every time I wind up back at your door
Why do you do this to me?
You penetrate right through me
Every time I wind up back at your door
No need to cry about it
I may just die without it
Every time I wind up back at your door
Why do you do this to me?
You penetrate right through me
Every time I wind up back at your door
Every time I wind up  back at your door
Every time I wind up back at your door"
Can't Stop,"All alone in my room, think of you
At a rate that is truly alarming
I keep looping my memories of you in my head
I pretend that you want me
And I fall asleep
And dream of alternate realities
And I put myself at ease
By pretending that she still loves me
And I can't stop thinking about you
And I can't stop thinking about you
And you never could or would do what I do
And I can't stop thinking about your love
Can't believe I could think that she would
Just follow me everywhere I go
I just wrestle with you in my dreams
And wake up making love to a pillow
And I fall asleep
And dream of alternate realities
And I put myself at ease
By pretending that she still loves me
And I can't stop thinking about you
And I can't stop thinking about you
You never could or would do what I do
And I can't stop and I can't stop
What I would give to have you look in my direction?
And I'd give my life to somehow attract your attention
And I touch myself like it's somebody else
Thoughts of you attached to, on my mind, let me show you
I can't stop thinking about you
And I can't stop thinking about you
And you never could or would do what I do
And I can't stop thinking about you
And I can't stop thinking about you
I can't stop thinking about you
And you never could or would do what I do
I can't stop thinking about you"
Kiwi,"You're such a flirt, I know you hurt
And so do I, I empathize
I see you out, you never cared
A conversation that we never shared
But it's so strange, it's something new
Amazing feelings that I have for you
I close my eyes when I'm alone
Wonder what it'd be like to make you moan
I wanna give you something better
Than anything you've ever had
A stronger and a faster lover
The world, it disappears so fast
Sweet kiwi
Your juices dripping down my chin
So please, let me
Don't stop it before it begins
So give it up and don't pretend
And spread your arms and legs across the bed
And when you shake, you won't regret
The things I whisper in your ear
(What?)
I said
I wanna give you something better
(You wanna give me something better)
Anything you've ever had
(Than anything I've ever had)
A stronger and a faster lover
(A stronger and a faster lover)
The world, it disappears so fast
(It disappears so fast)
Sweet kiwi
Your juices dripping down my chin
So please, let me
Don't stop it before it begins
I can't wait to take you home
Fingers through your hair
Kisses on your back
Scratch me with your nails
Save me from myself
Show me how to care
Get everything out
Dripping everywhere
Lipstick smeared all over your face
How much longer must we wait?
Don't think that I can wait
Sweet kiwi
Your juices dripping down my chin
So please, let me
Don't stop me before it begins
Sweet kiwi
(Wanna give you something better than this)
Your juices dripping down my chin
So please, let me
(Wanna give you something better than this)
Don't stop it before it begins
Don't stop it before it begins
Don't stop it before it begins
Don't stop it before it begins
Don't stop it before it begins"
Nothing Lasts Forever,"It is so easy to see
Dysfunction between you and me
We must free up these tired souls
Before the sadness gets us both
I tried and tried to let you know
I love you but I'm letting go
It may not last but I don't know
Just don't know
If you don't know then you can't care
And I show up but you're not there
But I'm waiting and you want to
Still afraid that I will desert you
Everyday with every word whispered
We get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
But nothing last forever but be honest, babe
It hurts but it may be the only way
A web that's warm with memories
Can heal us temporarily
The misbehaving all it makes
The ditch between us so damn deep
Built a wall around my heart
Never let it fall apart
Strangely I wish secretly
It won't fall down while I'm asleep
If you don't know then you can't care
And I show up but you're not there
But I'm waiting and you want to
Still afraid that I will desert you, babe
Everyday with every word whispered
We get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
But nothing last forever but be honest, babe
It hurts but it may be the only way
But we have not hit the ground
Doesn't mean we're not still falling
I want so bad to pick you up
But you're still too reluctant to accept my help
What a shame
I hope you find somewhere
To place the blame
But until then the fact remains
Everyday with every word whispered
We get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
Nothing last forever, but be honest, babe
It hurts but it may be the only way
Everyday with every word whispered
We get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
But nothing last forever, but be honest, babe
It hurts but it may be the only way"
Won't Go Home Without You,"I asked her to stay but she wouldn't listen
And she left before I had the chance to say
The words that would mend the things that were broken
But now it's far too late she's gone away
Every night you cry yourself to sleep
Thinking why does this happen to me?
Why does every moment have to be so hard?
Hard to believe it
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
The taste of her breath, I'll never get over
And the noises that she made kept me awake
The weight of the things that remain unspoken
Built up so much, it crushed us every day
Every night you cry yourself to sleep
Thinking, why does this happen to me?
Why does every moment have to be so hard?
Hard to believe it
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
Of all the things I've felt I've never really showed
Perhaps the worst is that I ever let you go
I should not ever let you go
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
And I won't go home without you
And I won't go home without you
And I won't go home without you"
Hello,"Well I don't feel as if I know you
You take up all my time
The days are long and the nights will throw you away
'Cos the sun won't shine
Nobody ever mentions the weather to make or break your day
Nobody ever seems to remember, life is a game we play
We live in the shadows and we had the chance and threw it away
And it's never gonna be the same
'Cos the years are fallin' by like the rain
It's never gonna be the same
Until' my mind's knew, comes to my house and says
Hello
There ain't no sense in feeling lonely
They got no faith in you
But I've got a feeling, you still owe me
So wipe from your shoes
Nobody ever mentions the weather to make or break your day
Nobody ever seems to remember, the life is a game we play
We live in the shadows and we had the chance and threw it away
And it's never gonna be the same
'Cos the years are fallin' by like the rain
It's never gonna be the same
Until' my mind's knew, comes to my house and says
Hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello
Hello, hello
Oh yeah"
Must Get Out,"I've been the needle and the thread
Weaving figure eights and circles round your head
I try to laugh but cry instead
Patiently wait to hear the words you've never said
Fumbling through your dresser drawer
Forgot what I was looking for
Try to guide me in the right direction
And making use of all this time
Keeping everything inside
Close my eyes and listen to you crying
I'm lifting you up, I'm letting you down
I'm dancing 'til dawn, I'm fooling around
And I'm not giving up, I'm making your love
This city's made us crazy and we must get out
And this is not goodbye she said
It is just time for me to rest my head
She does not walk, she runs instead
Down these jagged streets and into my bed
When I was fumbling through your dresser drawer
Forgot what I was looking for
Try to guide me in the right direction
Making use of all this time
Keeping everything inside
Close my eyes and listen to you crying
I'm lifting you up, I'm letting you down
I'm dancing 'til dawn, I'm fooling around
I'm not giving up, I'm making your love
This city's made us crazy and we must get out
There's only so much I can do for you
After all of the things you put me through
Oh, I'm lifting you up, I'm letting you down
I'm dancing 'til dawn, I'm fooling around
I'm not giving up, I'm making your love
This city's made us crazy and we must get out
I'm lifting you up, I'm letting you down
I'm dancing 'til dawn, I'm fooling around
I'm not giving up, I'm making your love
This city's made us crazy and we must get out
I'm lifting you up, I'm letting you down
(Whoa, whoa)
I'm dancing 'til dawn, I'm fooling around
(Whoa, whoa)
I'm not giving up, I'm making your love
(Whoa, yeah)
This city's made us crazy and we must get out"
Not Coming Home,"When you refuse me, you confuse me
What makes you think I'll let you in again?
Think again, my friend
Go on, misuse me and abuse me
I'll come out stronger in the end
Does it make you sad to find yourself alone?
Does it make you mad to find that I have grown?
I'll bet it hurts so bad to see the strength that I have shown
When you answer the door, pick up the phone
You won't find me 'cause I'm not coming home
You do not know how much this hurts me
To say these things that I don't want to say
But have to say them anyway, oh
I would do anything to end your suffering
But you would rather walk away
Does it make you sad to find yourself alone?
Does it make you mad to find that I have grown?
I'll bet it hurts so bad to see the strength that I have shown
When you answer the door, pick up the phone
You won't find me 'cause I'm not coming home, oh yeah
Does it make you sad to find yourself alone?
Does it make you mad to find that I have grown?
Does it make you sad to find yourself alone, yeah?
Does it make you mad to see that I have grown?
I'll bet it hurts so bad to see the strength that I have shown, oh
When you answer the door, pick up the phone
You wont find me 'cause I'm not coming home yeah, yeah
When you answer the door, pick up the phone
You wont find me 'cause I'm not coming home yeah, yeah
When you answer the door, pick up the phone
You wont find me 'cause I'm not coming home"
Secret,"Watch the sunrise
Say your goodbyes
Off we go
Some conversation
No contemplation
Hit the road
Car overheats
Jump out of my seat
On the side of the highway baby
Our road is long
Your hold is strong
Please don't ever let go, oh no
I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
Oh can they keep it
Oh no they can't
Driving fast now
Don't think I know how to go slow
Where you at now
I feel around
There you are
Cool these engines
Calm these jets
I ask you how hot can it get
And as you wipe of beads of sweat
Slowly you say, ""I'm not there yet""
I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
Oh can they keep it
Oh no they can't
I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
Oh but can they keep it
Oh no they can't"
Sweetest Goodbye,"Where you are seems to be
As far as an eternity
Outstretched arms, open heart
And if it never ends then when do we start?
I'll never leave you behind
Or treat you unkind
I know you understand, oh
And with a tear in my eye
Give me the sweetest goodbye
That I ever did receive
Pushing forward and arching back
Bring me closer to heart attack
Say goodbye and just fly away
When you've comeback, I have some thing to say, yeah
How does it feel to know you never have to be alone
When you get home, home
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I
Dream away everyday
Try so hard to disregard
The rhythm of the rain that drops
And coincides with the beating of my heart
I'll never leave you behind
Or treat you unkind
And I know you'll understand, yeah, yeah, yeah
And with a tear in my eye
Give me the sweetest goodbye
That I ever, ever, ever did receive
Pushing forward and arching back
Bring me closer to heart attack
Say goodbye and just fly away
When you'll comeback and I have some thing to say, yeah
How does it feel to know you never have to be alone
When you get home, home
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I feel, feel, feel, feel
How does it feel to know you never have to be alone
When you get home, home
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I feel
Show you how I feel
Show you how I feel
Show I, show you
Show you how I feel
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I feel"
Tangled,"I'm full of regrets for all the things
That I've done and said
And I don't know if it'll ever be okay to show
My face around here
Sometimes I wonder if I disappear
Would you ever turn your head and look
See if I'm gone 'cause I fear
There is nothing left to say to you
That you wanna hear
That you wanna know
I think I should go
The things I've done are way too shameful
Your just an innocent
Helpless victim of a spider's web
And I'm an insect
Going after anything that I can get
So you better turn your head and run
And don't look back 'cause I fear
There is nothing left to say to you
That you wanna hear
That you wanna know
I think I should go
The things I've done are way too shameful
And I've done you so wrong
Treated you bad, strung you along
Oh, shame on myself
I don't know how I got so tangled up
Ohh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You better turn your head and look
See if I'm gone 'cause I fear
There is nothing left to say to you
That you wanna hear
That you wanna know
I think I should go
The things I've done are way too shameful
And I've done you so wrong
And treated you bad, strung you along
Oh, shame on myself
I don't know how I got so tangled up
Strung you along
Oh, shame on myself
I don't know how I got so tangled up"
Through With You,"Can you see me
Floating above your head
As you lay in bed
Thinking about everything
That you did not do
Cause saying I love you
Has nothing to do with meaning it
And I don't trust you
Cause every time you're here
Your intentions are unclear
I spend every hour waiting for a phone call
That I know will never come
I used to think you were the one
Now I'm sick of thinking anything at all
You ain't ever coming back to me
That's not how things were supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back
No other lover has ever done that
Do you remember
The way we used to melt
Do you remember how it felt
When I touched you
Oh cause I remember very well
And how long has it been
Since someone you let in
Has given what I gave to you
And at night when you sleep
Do you dream I would be there
Just for a minute or two do you?
You ain't ever coming back to me
That's not how things were supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back
No other lover has ever done that
Heartache heartache I just have so much
A simple love with a complex touch
There is nothing you can say or do
I called to let you know I'm through with you"
Wasted Years,"Slow is the memory
I can picture her standin' right in front of me
Orange blossoms crushed on concrete
I walk around with bare feet, 'cuz I know you want me
Can't remember anything
Her skin it tastes like sugar cane
And I had already gotten there before I came
My tank is empty and I know you're thirsty
But I have already tried to explain myself
It's not that I love someone else
But I can't bear to listen to your cry, yeah
I'm sick of all these wasted years
A rag for someone else's tears
I wring you out as I hang you out to dry
No, no, no, no, no, no, yeah
And I'll see you when I get back
Maybe we can get ourselves back on the right track
You touch me there because you know how much I like that
I think that we will need to relax 'cuz I know you want me
All the time and everywhere
A happy surface but the underbelly isn't there
The worst thing is that I don't even really care
The emptiness is too much to bear
But I have already tried to explain myself
It's not that I love someone else
But I can't bear to listen to your cry
I'm sick of all these wasted years
A rag for someone else's tears
I wring you out as I hang you out to
C'mon c'mon, get off the phone, please, come home
It's been so lonely since you've been gone
Your love surround me, up and down me
Be all around me, baby, I can't breathe no more
C'mon c'mon, get off the phone, please, come home
It's been so lonely since you've been gone
Your love surround me, up and down me
Be all around me, baby, I can't breathe no more
But I have already tried to explain myself
It's not that I love someone else
But I can't bear to listen to your cry
I'm sick of all these wasted years
A rag for someone else's tears
I wring you out as I hang you out to dry
Sick of all these wasted years
A rag for someone else's tears
I wring you out as I hang you out to, to, dry
To try, try to get back home
Try, you try, yeah"
Way I Was (Non-Lp Version),"Making love to a picture frame
One more time tonight
You can tell by the lines in her smile
Something is not right
Where are you hiding?
She's on the outside
I'm on the inside crying
Just another crazy boy hungry for your
Hot love, wrap yourself around me like a warm glove
The emptiness leaves me
And I feel the never need to go back
To the way I was, the way I was
I've tried and tried and tried and tried
But I've no concept of consequence
And I'm a master of self defense
Days get longer, life gets shorter
She rips me like no other
So oh, dripping from head to toe
Where are you hiding?
She's on the outside
I'm on the inside crying
Hot love, wrap yourself around me like a warm glove
The emptiness leaves me
And I feel the never need to go back
To the way I was, the way I was
Hot love, wrap yourself around me like a warm glove
The emptiness leaves me
And I feel the never need to go back
To the way I was, the way I was
And I can't make the same mistake
If you lose my love, it was yours to take
Break down your door, take a little more
When I need you around
And I'm so terrified of leaving, it's a new low
Try and pick me up again but let go
See how far I get without you
Desperately need more of your
Hot love, wrap yourself around me like a warm glove
The emptiness leaves me
And I feel the never need to go back
To the way I was, the way I was
Hot love, wrap yourself around me like a warm glove
The emptiness leaves me
And I feel the never need to go back
To the way I was, the way I was"
Towering Over Rivals,"I didn't hear what you were saying
I live on raw emotion, baby
I answer questions, never maybe
And I'm not kind if you betray me
So who the hell are you to save me?
I never would've made it, baby
If you needed love, well then ask for love
Could've given love, now I'm taking love
And it's not my fault, cause you both deserve
What's coming now, so don't say a word
Wake up call, caught you in the morning
With another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Don't you care about me? I don't think so
Six foot tall, came without a warning
So I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here, I don't think so
I would've bled to make you happy
You didn't need to treat me that way
And now you've beat me at my own, game
And now I found you sleeping sound
And now your love is screaming loudly
I hear a sound and hit the ground
If you needed love, well then ask for love
Could've given love, now I'm taking love
And it's not my fault, cause you both deserve
What's coming now, so don't say a word
Wake up call, caught you in the morning
With another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Don't you care about me? I don't think so
Six foot tall, came without a warning
So I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here, I don't feel so bad
I don't feel so bad
I don't feel so bad
I'm so sorry, darling
Did I do the wrong thing?
Oh, what was I thinking?
Is his heart still beating?
Wake up call, caught you in the morning
With another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Don't you care about me? I don't think so
Six foot tall, came without a warning
So I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here, I don't feel so bad
Wake up call, caught you in the morning
With another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Don't you care about me? I don't think so
Six foot tall, came without a warning
So I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
No, he won't come around here
I don't feel so bad
Don't feel so bad
Don't feel so bad"
Angel In Blue Jeans,"I saw an angel in blue jeans today
It felt as she melted all my bitterness away
You always tried so hard
To hide you'r wings behind you'r coat
So let it be
And let them free
So you can hover low
Above the ground
You look so tired
You moon beams in you'r eyes
And if I belived,
I knew you'd be the first to fly
You always tried so hard
To hide you'r wings behind you'r coat
So let it be
And let them free
So you can hover low
Above the ground
I'll find sunshine,
Sometime soon
How can I miss anything about you,
When I don't even know what you'r name is?
I feel like I know you
As well as I know the sun
So please tell me,
Where is my sunshine now?
I'll find sunshine,
Sometime soon
How can I miss anything about you,
When I don't even know what you'r name is?
I feel like I know you
As well as I know the sun
So please tell me,
Where is my sunshine now?
How can I miss anything about you,
When I don't even know what you'r name is?
I feel like I know you
As well as I know the sun
I wonder,
Where is my sunshine now?"
As Things Collide,"You have this way of dipping in and out of
Sight as things collide
Bridges burning softly in the night
And you have this way of falling in and out of
Time as it goes by
Passing silently with no goodbye
And I've spoken with all the other angels
They dont know what to do
And i agree with them whole-heartedly, I do
Tellogram came today from a friend
Saying, ""Where in the hell have you been?
Where are you goin'?""
I said, ""I dont know, does the lonliness show?
And if so does it ever end?""
And I've spoken with all the other angels
They dont know what to do
And I agree with them whole-heartedly, I do
You have this way of meaning everything and nothing to me
At the same time
Returning my hellos with goodbyes
'Cause I've spoken with all the other angels
They dont know what to do
And I agree with them whole-heartedly, I do...
'Cause I've spoken with all the other angels
They dont know what to do
And I agree with them whole-heartedly, I do...
And I've spoken with all the other angels
They dont know what to do
And I agree with them whole-heartedly, I do"
Control Myself,"I have told all of my enemies
Very politely to go home
I have seen all of your remedies
Now won't you let me please go home?
I can't find anything to be sad about
They say I'm doomed but I feel fine
I have tried so very hard as hell
To stay away from hell and live upstairs
But when I see all of your remedies
I try quite desperately to go home
I can't find anything to be sad about
They say I'm doomed but I feel fine
But if I'm sitting here lonely
With no one to hold me
At least I'll have my health
I'm trying to control myself
I have told all of my enemies
Very politely to go home
I have seen all of your remedies
Now won't you let me please go home?
I've been acting irresponsibly
But what could possibly go wrong?
I have choked on all your remedies
Now won't you let me please go home?
But if I sit here lonely
With no one to hold me
At least I'll have my health
I'm trying to control myself
I'm trying to control
Myself"
Figure It Out,"I'm happy you came to me first before the bubble burst
I'm happy you answered my calls, I'm bouncing off the walls
Impossible to be tamed, her need cellophane
I'm happy you like to play games, why did you run away?
We could spend some time together
What he had he'll never know
Your boyfriend gives you no respect
And I can see you're getting it
So figure it out and let's go
I'm happy you're so impulsive, means that you're passionate
I'm happy you're moving so fast but will it ever last?
I know you wanna break free from this monotony
I'm happy you're coming with me but by choice it's gotta be
We can spend some time together
What he has he'll never know
Your boyfriend gives you no respect
And I can see you're getting it
So figure it out and let's go
I'm happy you're changing your speed, slow down and lay with me
On bottom but always discrete, kneel down and kiss her feet
I'm happy you're going too far, full strength before we start
Sometimes you make it so hard, scream loud as we come apart
We can spend some time together
What he had he'll never know
Your boyfriend gives you no respect
And I can see you're getting it
So figure it out and let's go
We can spend some time together
What he has he'll never know
Your boyfriend gives you no respect
And I can see you're getting it
So figure it out and let's go
Figure it out and let's go
Figure it out and let's go
Figure it out and let's go"

I Won't Go Home Without You,"I asked her to stay
But she wouldn't listen
She left before I had the chance to say (Oh-oh)
The words that would mend
The things that were broken
But now it's far too late, she's gone away
Every night you cried yourself to sleep
Thinking: ""Why does this happen to me?
Why does every moment have to be so hard?""
Hard to believe it
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
The taste of her breath, I'll never get over
The noises that she made kept me awake (Oh)
The weight of the things that remained unspoken
Built up so much it crushed us everyday
Every night you  cried yourself to sleep
Thinking: ""Why does this happen to me?
Why does every moment have to be so hard?""
Hard to believe it
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Of all the things I felt but never really showed
Perhaps the worst is that I ever let you go
I should not ever let you go (oh-oh-oh)
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you (oh-oh-oh-oh)
It's not over tonight
Just give me one chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
And I won't go home without you
And I won't go home without you
I won't go home without you"
If You Only Knew,"I wake up thoughts of you tattooed to my mind
As I wonder what to wear, what to eat, who to be
Will I see you again? And as my car breaks down
I shake my head and say, ""What a day??
If you only knew
What I went through just to get to you
I'm hanging from you
And I'll hold on if you want me to
Every bus, every train
Ever cab, every lane is jammed
So I look to the sky
And I reach for the planes with my hands
If all my days go wrong
I'll think about last night
It went right
If you only knew
What I went through just to get to you
I'm hanging from you
And I'll hold on if you want me to
If you only knew
What I went through just to get to you
I'm swinging from you
And there's nothing I would rather do"
Infatuation,"Baby, I don't wanna spend my life on trial
For something that I did not do
And maybe if you stopped and looked around sometime
I wouldn't pass right by you
Maybe it's because you are so insecure
And maybe your pain don't care
Maybe it's the chase that really gets me off
It falls away and it's just not there
You burn another bridge
Break another heart
You try again, it will only fall apart
Infatuation, not seeing the rest of you
Is getting the best of me
It's such a shame that you shot me down
Would have been nice to be around
I'm touching your skin
If it's only a fantasy then why is it killing me?
And I guess this must be infatuation
I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it
I want it, I want it, I want it
I try to put my finger on what burns me up
It always seems to escape me
And when you have decided that you've had enough
Just tell me where I need to be
And now her face is something that I never had
To ever deal with before
She left me with the feeling that she'd had enough
And I'm the one wanting more
Burn another bridge
Break another heart
You try again, it will only fall apart
Infatuation, not seeing the rest of you
Is getting the best of me
It's such a shame that you shot me down
Would have been nice to be around
I'm touching your skin
If it's only a fantasy then why is it killing me?
And I guess this must be infatuation
I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it
I want it, I want it, I want it
I'm so attracted to you
The feeling's mutual too
And I get scared the moment you leave
Get so hot, I forget to breathe, yeah
Infatuation, not seeing the rest of you
Is getting the best of me
It's such a shame that you shot me down
Would have been nice to be around
I'm touching your skin
If it's only a fantasy then why is it killing me?
And I guess this must be infatuation
I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it
I want it, I want it, I want it
I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it
I want it, I want it, I want it"
Losing My Mind,"It's so hard to find you
I'm standing right behind you
Streets are much colder
Must mean I'm getting older
Why would you? How could I?
These questions lead to goodbye
Now I got my freedom, don't I?
I parked my car outside your house
Hoping someday you'll come home
It seems the woman that I love
Is someone that I hardly know
And after all this time
I finally found the way to be alone
I'm terrified, I think that I
May be losing my mind
The shy girl's so humble
With thighs that make me stumble
Somehow not speaking
Lets me know everything
I go out, you eat in
Hide from the situation
You're naked in daylight
Wrap yourself up in goodnight
I'm burning, I'm hungry
Angry 'cause she don't love me
You've got me completely
In my own game you beat me
I parked my car outside your house
Hoping someday you'll come home
It seems the woman that I love
Is someone that I hardly know
And after all this time
I finally found the way to be alone
I'm terrified, I think that I
May be losing my mind
I will be back again
No, this is not the end
I've fallen hard this time
But I'm not giving in
I want the world to know
That I won't let you forget
The tears that you shed
I'll make it impossible to let go
I parked my car outside your house
Hoping someday you'll come home
It seems the woman that I love
Is someone that I hardly know
And after all this time
I finally found the way to be alone
I'm terrified, I think that I
May be losing my mind
I parked my car outside your house
I hope that someday you'll come home
It seems the woman that I love
Is someone that I hardly know
And after all this time
I finally found the place to be alone
I'm terrified, I think that I
May be losing my mind"
M,"If good girls get down on the floor
Tell me how low will a bad girl go
[Verse]
I wake up with blood-shot eyes
Struggled to memorize
The way it felt between your thighs
Pleasure that made you cry
Feel so good to be bad
Not worth the aftermath, after that
After that
Try to get you back
[Bridge]
I still don't have the reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you
[Chorus]
Give me something to believe in
Cause I don't believe in you anymore
Anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to try
(Yeah)
So this is goodbye
[Verse]
God damn my spinning head
Decisions that made my bed
Now I must lay in it
And deal with things I left unsaid
I want to dive into you
Forget what you're going through
I get behind, make your move
Forget about the truth
[Bridge]
I still don't have the reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you
[Chorus]
Give me something to believe in
Cause I don't believe in you anymore
Anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference,
It even makes a difference to try
And you tell me how you feelin
But I don't believe it's true anymore
Anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
(Oh no)
So this is goodbye
[Breakdown]
I've been here before
One day I wake up
And it won't hurt anymore
You caught me in a lie
I have no alibi
The words you said don't have a meaning
Cause
[Bridge]
I still don't have the reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you
and I...And so this is goodbye
[Chorus]
Give me something to believe in
Cause I don't believe in you anymore
Anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference,
It even makes a difference to try
And you tell me how you feelin
But I don't believe it's true anymore
Anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
(Oh no)
So this is goodbye
So this is goodbye, yeah [x3]

"Miss You, Love You","This is not been easy, this has been hard
I am scarred and I do not know what to do with you
Go inside, kiss your mouth, lick my lips, strap your hips
Can't remember why I fell in love with this
I miss you, I love you
It's a shame you can't stay away from me this time, oh no
You beg me, you ask me to kiss you and hug you
You won't be getting my affection again, oh no
I don't need you
Who do you think you are? No one cares about a name without a face
So don't go shooting up the place
Make no mistake, your love's not real 'cause the love I've got is deeper
So much deeper than you can ever feel
And I miss you, I love you
It's a shame you can't stay away from me this time, oh no
You beg me, you ask me to kiss you and hug you
You won't be getting my affection again, oh no
'Cause I don't need you tonight
It was really nice to know you and nothing left to show you
I got bills to pay, get out of the way, it's time to move on
And dinner with your boyfriend will never be the same again
Discuss me over cigarettes and say to him
I miss you, I love you
It's a shame, you can't stay away from me this time, oh no
You beg me, you ask me to kiss you and hug you
You won't be getting my affection again, oh no
'Cause I don't need you
I miss you, I love you
It's a shame, you can't stay away from me this time, oh no
You beg me, you ask me to kiss you, hug you
You won't be getting my affection again, no, no
'Cause I won't need you"
My Ocean Blue,"I once heard Captain Dan tell me a story
about this lovely girl who's name was Jane
She was vast and deep and filled with glory
Aaaahhhh
Bottom served as home for hull and anchor
She's always fit to quarrel with the wind
The great Titanic yes it's she that sank her
Aaaahhhh
Then she heard me
Say that oath that
made everything clear
I love you
My ocean blue
I like the way your sea sees me
My darling Jane
She speaks to me at times through falling rain
Now twas time to manifest her vigor
Was she fit to quarrel with the wind?
The air was strong but Jane she was much bigger
Aaaaahhhh
Then she heard me
say that oath that
made everything clear
I love you
My ocean blue
I like the way your sea sees me
My darling Jane
Oh me, my darling Jane
Oh me and my darling Jane
She speaks to me at times through falling rain
Speaks to me at times through falling rain"
Pure Imagination,"Come with me and you'll be
In a world of pure imagination

Into your imagination

Trav'ling in the world of my creation
What we'll see will defy
Explanation
If you want to view paradise
Simply look around and view it
Anything you want to, do it

Ragdoll,"How you feelin'?
The day has had its way with both of us
And no, I've gone out of my way
But I'm not free from this pain I'm reelin'
I was a fool to think someday you would come around
But no, no, no, I'm not thinkin' that way
'Cause now I see, you are not what you seem
You are a mystery to me
Sometimes I just wanna scream
I think you should just go away 'cause
There's no necessity for you to stay, yeah
Next time you come around my way
Forget it baby, you're not comin' in
How's your day been? Yeah
'Cause mine has taken strange and lovely turns
But no, no, no, I feel better today
'Cause I'm off my knees, you are not what you seem
You are a mystery to me
Sometimes I just wanna scream, yeah
I think you should just go away 'cause
There's no necessity for you to stay, yeah
Next time you come around my way
Forget it baby, you're not comin' in
A heart ready for a lot of sorrow
No, you can't come back tomorrow
Shut my windows, lock my doors
'Cause my heart won't be your ragdoll anymore, yeah
I think you should just go away 'cause
There's no necessity for you to stay, yeah
Next time you come around my way
Forget it baby, you're not comin' in
A heart ready for a lot of sorrow
No you can't come back tomorrow
Shut my windows, lock my doors

'Cause my heart won't be your ragdoll anymore"
Simple Kind Of Lovely,"Leaning on a tree trunk
Thinking all the same junk
Falling in and out of a dream
Back and forth I'm swaying
I'm contemplating staying
Laying and decaying
When I know I must leave
Where do I aim when I shoot the breeze?
How do I calm myself at times like these?
I need a simple kind of lovely
And the *thought* is just a novelty
You can spend the whole time
Dangling from a grape vine
Standing underneath you
When they cut you free
What about when the sun leaves?
And what about all those bad dreams?
Who will walk you back into reality?
I wish things could be like this everyday
But I know that I could never live this way
It was just a simple kind of lovely
And the memories will be ok
The memories will be ok
Memories will be ok"
Story,"Do you mean all the things you are?
Are you pleased with the way things are?
Wear that dress to protect this scar
That only I have seen
Do you give just to please yourself?
Do you wish you were somewhere else?
Justified all the things you tried
Said that it was all for me
And be near just for the moment
Stay here, never go home
Did you know
That everything she ever does is for you?
So it goes
As the story of a broken heart comes true, it comes true
Have you learned all the secrets yet?
Were you burned by the things I've said?
Took the dive just to feel alive
But never heard the truth
Now I'm in love but I don't know how
And I'm in pain 'cause I want it now
And as I sit watching her eyes close
I slowly open mine
Be near just for the moment
Stay here, never go home
Did you know
That everything she ever does is for you?
So it goes
As the story of a broken heart comes true, comes true
I am so confused by this
I know that life is hit or miss
Days are stung by too much sun
I think that you may be the one
Cover yourself up in me
Shrouded in what could have been
I will listen to your pain
If you listen to me
Did you know
That everything she ever does is for you?
So it goes
As the story of a broken heart comes true
Did you know
That everything she ever does is for you?
And I know
As the story of a broken heart comes true, comes true
True, it comes true, true"
Sweetest Goodbye/sunday Morning,"Where you are seems to be
As far as an eternity
Outstretched arms open hearts
And if it never ends then when do we start?
I'll never leave you behind
Or treat you unkind
I know you understand
And with a tear in my eye
Give me the sweetest goodbye
That I ever did receive
Pushing forward and arching back
Bring me closer to heart attack
Say goodbye and just fly away
When you comeback
I have some things to say
How does it feel to know you never have to be alone
When you get home
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I
Dream away everyday
Try so hard to disregard
The rhythm of the rain that drops
And coincides with the beating of my heart
I'll never leave you behind
Or treat you unkind
I know you understand
And with a tear in my eye
Give me the sweetest goodbye
That I ever did receive
Pushing forward and arching back
Bring me closer to heart attack
Say goodbye and just fly away
When you comeback
I have some things to say
How does it feel to know you never have to be alone
When you get home
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I feel"
Take What You Want,"I woke up this morning with the burden of love hanging over my head as I
Walked into the living room
Sit with you, discuss whats going on
Is it me?
Is it you?
Is it something I forgot to do?
Tell me so that I understand
I just need some time
Gather all my thoughts
To make up for the love I just lost
You've been so good to me, given me everything
Take what you want cause it doesn't belong to me
I woke up this morning with the hurting that I would never ever wish upon
Even my worst enemy
Who is she, what the hell do you people want?
Is it me?
Is it you?
Is it something i forgot to do?
Tell me so that i understand
I just need some time
Gather all my thoughts
To make up for the love I just lost
You've been so good to me given me everything
Take what you want cause it doesn't belong to me anyway
I just need some time
Gather all my thoughts
To make up for the love I just lost
You've been so good to me given me everything
Take what you want cause it doesn't belong to me"
That's Not Enough,"She was a bad thing coming, but I did not know
And every time I came over she told me I had to go
I said, ""Hey, what's going on? I really want to know""
She said, ""I cannot tell you now, but I'll call you tomorrow""
That's not enough, I want more, I want it all
I want to bang on your front door
Turn off the lights and shut out the world
'Cause at the end of the day
Aren't we all just boys and girls?
Yeah, she's snake me with sophistication, so much class
She drinks a Santa margarita, would you like a glass?
I don't know how to say no, and after three or four
I was on the floor singing my song, la la la, no, no
That's not enough, I want more, I want it all
I want to bang on your front door
Turn off the lights and shut out the world
'Cause at the end of the day
Aren't we all just boys and girls?
Yeah, la la la, no, no
That's not enough, I want more, I want it all
I want to bang on your front door
Turn off the lights and shut out the world
'Cause at the end of the day
Aren't we all just boys and girls?
Aren't we all just boys and girls?
Aren't we all just boys and girls?
(All just boys and girls)
Oh yeah, oh
Aren't we all just boys and girls?
Aren't we all just boys and girls?
Yeah, oh"
The Fog,"Here in this town they have all got the blues
As the paper boy takes off without any news
Angels have wings you can feel free to use
The corner store drugs you can freely abuse
And Im yelling and screaming cause baby youre driving me crazy
So life on your own has been vacant and cold
Everyones getting somewhere and youre getting old
Career opportunities they all have been sold
Along with your body and most of your soul
And Im yelling and screaming cause baby youre driving me crazy
If I could spare more remorse from my emptied out pores I would maybe
Cause the fogs getting thicker the worlds spinning fast
The chaos is building, its going too last
And its so hard to see and youre so hard to find
The days when I think I am losing my mind
So keep painting pictures of beautiful scenes
Striking the canvas with deep blues and greens
When you start frowning they think youre obscene
As you work overtime to make sure they can dream
Im yelling and screaming cause baby youre driving me crazy
If I could spare more remorse from my emptied out pores I would maybe
Cause the fogs getting thicker the worlds spinning fast
The chaos is building, its going too last
And its so hard to see and youre so hard to find
The days when I think I am losing my mind
And we yell and we scream
As the fogs getting thicker the worlds spinning fast
The chaos is building, its going to last
And its so hard to see and youre so hard to find
The days when I think I am losing my mind
And the fogs getting thicker the worlds spinning fast
The chaos is building, its going to last
And its so hard to see and youre so hard to find
The days when I think I am losing my mind"
The Way I Was,"Making love to a picture frame
One more time tonight
You can tell by the lines in her smile
Something is not right
Where are you hiding?
She's on the outside
I'm on the inside crying
Just another crazy boy hungry for your
Hot love, wrap yourself around me like a warm glove
The emptiness leaves me
And I feel the never need to go back
To the way I was, the way I was
I've tried and tried and tried and tried
But I've no concept of consequence
And I'm a master of self defense
Days get longer, life gets shorter
She rips me like no other
So oh, dripping from head to toe
Where are you hiding?
She's on the outside
I'm on the inside crying
Hot love, wrap yourself around me like a warm glove
The emptiness leaves me
And I feel the never need to go back
To the way I was, the way I was
Hot love, wrap yourself around me like a warm glove
The emptiness leaves me
And I feel the never need to go back
To the way I was, the way I was
And I can't make the same mistake
If you lose my love, it was yours to take
Break down your door, take a little more
When I need you around
And I'm so terrified of leaving, it's a new low
Try and pick me up again but let go
See how far I get without you
Desperately need more of your
Hot love, wrap yourself around me like a warm glove
The emptiness leaves me
And I feel the never need to go back
To the way I was, the way I was
Hot love, wrap yourself around me like a warm glove
The emptiness leaves me
And I feel the never need to go back
To the way I was, the way I was"
This Love (Croatian Translation),"I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart, oh!
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice
?Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied, oh!
Kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice
?Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
I'll fix these broken things
Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's alright
(It's alright, it's alright)
My pressure on your hips
Sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you
Because I know that's what you want me to do
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
Her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice
?Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And my heart is breaking in front of me
And she said goodbye too many times before
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
Her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice
?Cause I won't say goodbye anymore"
Until You're Over Me,"This relationship is over
Though my stomach still hurts
And now I wanna live alone
Why is the pain much worse?
You look so much better without makeup
Why would you hide your face?
Don't wanna spend the night and wake up
Realize we've made a big mistake
I cannot refuse your eyes
Please don't look at me tonight
My heart beats fast I know you're there
I pretend like I don't care
It hurts so bad to know the truth
But I am still in love with you
I never meant to keep you waiting
And now your food is getting cold
I keep denying I'm in love with you
My routine is getting old
And now you stand in front of the table
And say you never look back
Do something stupid when you're angry
You'll only wake up sad
I cannot refuse your eyes
Please don't look at me tonight
My heart beats fast I know you're there
And I pretend like I don't care
It hurts so bad to know the truth
But girl I am still in love with you
It hurts too much to know the truth
But girl I am still in love with you
No more kisses on your lips
No tender touches please
I'd rather die on my two feet
Than live down on my knees
And all because you get me
Opened up and start to believe
And I just can't get over you
Until you're over me
I cannot refuse your eyes
Please don't look at me tonight
My heart beats fast I know you're there
And I pretend like I don't care
And I cannot refuse your eyes
Please don't look at me tonight
My heart beats fast I know you're there
And I pretend like I don't care
It hurts too much to know the truth
But girl I'm still in love with you
It hurts too much to know the truth
But girl I'm still in love with you"
Closer,"You let me violate you,
you let me disgraces you
You let me complicate you, you let me penetrate you.
(Ohhhhhhho)
Help me,don’t pop out my inside.
Help me, got no soul to sell.
Help me, the only thing that works for me.
Help me, get away from myself.
I wanna fuck you like an animal.
I wanna feel u from the inside.
And I wanna fuck you like an animal.
My whole existence is flood,
you bring me closer to god.
You can’t help my isolation, you can’t help the hate it brings,
You can’t help my absent of faith,
you can’t help my everything.
Help me, turn on my reason. Help me, sex I can smell.
Help me, you make me perfect shape.
Help me, think im somebody else.
I wanna fuck you like an animal.
I wanna feel you from the inside.
I wanna fuck you like an animal.
My whole existence is flood, you bring me closer to god."
Don't Look Back In Anger (Oasis Cover),"Slip inside the eye of your mind
Don't you know you might find
A better place to play
You said that you'd never been
But all the things that you've seen
Slowly fade away
So I start a revolution from my bed
'Cause you said the brains I have went to my head
Step outside 'cause summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off you face
You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out
Chorus:
And so Sally can wait
She knows it's too late
As we're walking on by
Her soul slides away
But don't look back in anger
I heard you say
Take me to the place where you go
Where nobody knows
If it's night or day
Please don't put your life in the hands
Of a Rock 'n' Roll band
Who'll throw it all away
I'm gonna start a revoution from my bed
'Cause you said the brains I have went to my head
Step outside 'cause summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off you face
'Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out
Chorus x2
So Sally can wait
She knows it's too late
As she's walking on by
My soul slides away
But don't look back in anger
Don't look back in anger
I heard you say
At least not today"

You're right,
Or grow strong,

Oh, this is so funky,
Funky in my heart,
This girl is funky,
The girl in my dreams cracks me up.
Funky, oh that's the word,
But Jane, do you really care how funky styles of your could be?
Can you just see me lone-ly?
Funky is the word you could only say.
It's so funky,
Jane, can't you see?
You could be loved by any boy in the world,
Funky, it's the word.
The word is funky,
The word is funky,
Oh how a shame,
It's too funky."

Hello (Oasis Cover),"I don't feel as if I know you
You take up all my time
The days are long and the night will throw you away
Coz the sun don't shine
Nobody ever mentions the weather can make or break your day
Nobody ever seems to remember life is a game we play
We live in the shadows and we had the chance and threw it away
And it's never gonna be the same
Cos the years are falling by like the rain
And it's never gonna be the same
Till the life I knew comes to my house and says
Hello
There ain't no sense in feeling lonely
They got no faith in you
But I've got a feeling you still owe me
So wipe the shit from your shoes
Nobody ever mentions the weather can make or break your day
Nobody ever seems to remember life is a game we play
We live in the shadows and we had the chance and threw it away
And it's never gonna be the same
Cos the years are falling by like the rain
And it's never gonna be the same
Till the life I knew comes to my house and says
Hello
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
It's good to be back!"
If I Never See Your Face Again (Feat. Rihanna),"[Adam]
Now as the summer fades, I let you slip away
You say I’m not your type, But I can make you sway.
It makes you burn to learn, You’re not the only one
I’d let you be if you put down your blazing gun.
[Rihanna]
Now you’ve gone somewhere else, Far away
I don’t know if I will find you (find you, find you).
But you feel my breath, On your neck
Can’t believe I’m right behind you (right behind you).
[Both]
‘Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again, I don’t mind
‘Cause we gone much further than I thought we’d get tonight
[Rihanna]
Sometimes you move so well
It’s hard not to give in.
[Adam]
I’m lost, I can’t tell
Where you end and I begin.
[Rihanna]
It makes you burn to learn
I’m with another man.
[Adam]
I wonder if he’s half
The lover that I am.
[Adam]
Now you’ve gone somewhere else, Far away
I don’t know if I will find you (find you, find you).
But you feel my breath, On your neck
Can’t believe I’m right behind you (right behind you).
[Both]
‘Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again, I don’t mind
‘Cause we gone much further than I thought we’d get tonight
[Adam]
Baby, baby
Please believe me
Find it in your heart to reach me
Promise not to leave me behind
(Promise not to leave me behind)
[Rihanna]
Take me down, but take it easy
Make me think but don’t deceive me
Talk to me bout taking your time
(Talk to me, talk to me)
[Rihanna]
‘Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
[Both]
If I never see your face again, I don’t mind
‘Cause we gone much further than I thought we’d get tonight
[Both]
‘Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again, I don’t mind
‘Cause we gone much further than I thought we’d get tonight"
Lovely Day,"(feat. Bill Withers)
When I wake up in the morning, love
And the sunlight hurts my eyes
And something without warning, love
Bears heavy on my mind
Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be
A lovely day
...lovely day, lovely day, lovely day...
When the day that lies ahead of me
Seems impossible to face
When someone else instead of me
Always seems to know the way
Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be
A lovely day...
When the day that lies ahead of me
Seems impossible to face
When someone else instead of me
Always seems to know the way
Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be
A lovely day..."
Myself,"I have told
All of my enemies
Very polietly
To go home
I have seen
All of your remedies
Now won't you let me please
Go home?
I can't find anything to be sad about
They say I'm doomed, but I feel fine
I have tried
So very hard as hell
To stay away from hell
And live upstairs
But when I see
All of your remedies
I try quite desperately
To go home
I can't find anything to be sad about
They say I'm doomed, but I feel fine
But if I'm sitting here lonely with no one to hold me
At least I'll have my health
I'm trying to control myself
I have told
All of my enemies
Very polietly
To go home
I have seen
All of your remedies
Now won't you let me please
Go home?
I've been acting irresponsibly
But what could go possibly go wrong?
I have choked on all your remedies
Now won't you let me please
Go home?
But if I sit here lonely
With no one to hold me
At least I'll have my health
I'm trying to control myself
I'm trying to control
Myself"
Pleasure Fucker,"Hotter than the hesitation
Was the way you looked around then
Acting like some older woman you moved in
Pinned me to the ground I couldn't stop you
Making my imagination jealous of
A picture perfect situation
She has got me locked up tighter than I thought
She's a quick licking pleasure sucker
Hotter than a motherfucker
And she knows who she is
And she gives me whatever I want
I, retire to my room
Think of her as my vacation from myself
As she goes off with someone else
I sit (here) alone in desperation
Contemplating masturbation
I lean back serious slacka, heart attack
She has got me locked up hotter than I thought
She's a quick licking pleasure sucker
Hotter than a motherfucker
She has got me locked up hotter than I thought
She's a quick licking pleasure sucker
Hotter than a motherfucker
Ohhhh
She has got me locked up tighter than I thought
She's a quick licking pleasure sucker
Hotter than a motherfucker
And she knows who she is
And she gives me whatever I want
She has got me locked up tighter than I thought
She's a quick licking pleasure sucker
Hotter than a motherfucker
And she knows who she is
And she gives me whatever I want"
The Kid With The Velvet Eyes,"Every day, people sway
softly lulling me to sleep
I look the other way
but I still can't look too deep
I think I'll fall asleep
I think I'll fall asleep
So call up and tell him that you will survive
good looking kid with the velvet eyes
you and me and everything's gonna be fine
Every night, people fight
gently lulling me to sleep
what gives me the right
to waste away and weep
I think I'll turn away
there's nothing left to say
So call up and tell him that you will survive
good looking kid with the velvet eyes
you and me and everything's gonna be fine
so you wanna have everything your heart desires
there's a fist full of people with their hearts on fire
make your way on up to the front of the line
Get out of my way
I'm here now to stay
Get out of my way
I'm here now to stay
So call up and tell him that you will survive
good looking kid with the velvet eyes
you and me and everything's gonna be fine
so you wanna have everything your heart desires
there's a fist full of people with their hearts on fire
make your way on up to the front of the line"
The Reason,"I'm not a perfect person
Ther's many things I wish I didn't do
But I continue learnind
I never meant to do those things to you
And so I have to say before I go
That I just wnat you to know
I found the reason for me
To change who I use to be
A reason to start over new
And the reason is you
I'm sorry that I hurt you
It's something I must live with everyday
And all the pain I put you through
I wish that I could take it all away
And be the one who catches all you tears
That's why I need you to hear
I found the reason for me
To change who I use to be
A reason to start over new
And the reason is you
And the reason is you
And the reason is you
And the reason is you
I'm not a perfect person
I never meant to do those things to you
And so I have to say before I go
That I just want you to know
I found the reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
And the reason is you
I found a reason to show
A side of me you didn't know
A reason for all that I do
And the reason is you

Misery - Maroon 5,"Oh yeah
Oh yeah
So scared of breaking it
But you won’t let it bend
And I wrote two hundred letters
I won’t ever send
Somehow it is cut so much
Deeper then they seem
You’d rather cover up
I’d rather let them be
So let me be
And I’ll set you free
 
I am in misery
There ain’t no other
Who can comfort me
Why won’t you answer me?
Your silence is slowly killing me
Girl you really got me bad
You really got me bad
I’m gonna get you back
Gonna get you back
Your salty skin and how
It mixes in with mine
The way it feels to be
Completely intertwined
It’s not that I didn’t care
It’s that I didn’t know
It’s not what I didn’t feel,
It’s what I didn’t show
So let me be
And I’ll set you free
 
I am in misery
There ain’t no other
Who can comfort me
Why won’t you answer me?
Your silence is slowly killing me
Girl you really got me bad
You really got me bad
I’m gonna get you back
Gonna get you back
Say your faith is shaken
You may be mistaken
You keep me wide awake and
Waiting for the sun
I’m desperate and confused
So far away from you
I’m getting here
Don’t care where I have to go
Why do you do what you do to me, yeah
Why won’t you answer me, answer me yeah
Why do you do what you do to me yeah
Why won’t you answer me, answer me yeah
 
I am in misery
There ain’t no other
Who can comfort me
Why won’t you answer me?
Your silence is slowly killing me
Girl you really got me bad
You really got me bad
I’m gonna get you back
Gonna get you back"
